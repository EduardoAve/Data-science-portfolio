## 📁 Repository Structure

This portfolio is organized with each major project residing in its own dedicated folder within this repository. Each project folder contains:
* A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with the complete analysis and code.
* A specific `README.md` detailing the project's objectives, methodology, findings, and how to run it.
* (Potentially) A `requirements.txt` file for necessary libraries.
* (Potentially) Subfolders for data (with instructions, not raw data) or utility scripts (`src/`).

## 🚀 Projects Showcase

Here's a summary of the key projects included in this portfolio:

1.  **🏠 House Price Prediction (Regression)**
    * **Folder:** [`house-price-regression/`](./house-price-regression/) *(<- Adjust link/folder name if needed)*
    * **Description:** Developed regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, RandomForest, GradientBoosting) to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. Involved extensive EDA, feature engineering, handling missing values, log-transformation of the target variable, and model evaluation using RMSE and MAE.
    * **Skills/Topics:** Regression, Feature Engineering, EDA, Data Cleaning, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Log Transformation, Model Comparison.
    * **Status:** Completed (Initial Modeling & Evaluation).

2.  **📈 Bank Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)**
    * **Folder:** [`bank-customer-churn/`](./bank-customer-churn/) *(<- Adjust link/folder name if needed)*
    * **Description:** Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict customer churn for a bank. Focused on EDA, preprocessing pipelines, handling imbalanced data (SMOTE/class weights), model evaluation (AUC, F1-Score), and feature importance interpretation.
    * **Skills/Topics:** Binary Classification, EDA, Scikit-learn Pipelines, Imbalanced Data, Feature Importance, Customer Analytics.
    * **Status:** Completed.

3.  **💬 IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (NLP - Baseline)**
    * **Folder:** [`imdb-sentiment-analysis/`](./imdb-sentiment-analysis/) *(<- Adjust link/folder name if needed)*
    * **Description:** Implemented a baseline sentiment analysis model (Logistic Regression) to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Utilized basic text cleaning and TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams. NLTK preprocessing was initially planned but simplified due to environment issues.
    * **Skills/Topics:** NLP, Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, TF-IDF, Scikit-learn, Baseline Modeling.
    * **Status:** Completed (Simplified Baseline).

4.  **🏙️ Boston Crime Data (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
    * **Folder:** [`boston-crime-eda/`](./boston-crime-eda/) *(<- Adjust link/folder name if needed)*
    * **Description:** Performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Boston Crime dataset. Focused on data cleaning (handling dates, coordinates, missing values), merging datasets, and univariate analysis through visualizations to uncover initial patterns in crime types, times, and locations.
    * **Skills/Topics:** EDA, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization (Seaborn/Matplotlib), Pandas, Data Wrangling.
    * **Status:** Initial EDA Completed (Further analysis planned).

*(More projects might be added over time)*
